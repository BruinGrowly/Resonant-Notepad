# Project Overview

## Purpose

Build a usable notepad application in Python that demonstrates resonance programming in practice.

This repository is intentionally a showcase:
- It should feel like a real writing tool.
- It should expose resonance signals in a transparent way.
- It should keep practical logic rails for reliability and safety.

## 80/20 Operating Model

The implementation targets:
- 80% resonance behavior:
  - Continuous harmony computation
  - Coupled state evolution (`L`, `J`, `P`, `W`)
  - Non-binary guidance based on alignment
  - Resonance-aware autosave cadence
- 20% logic rails:
  - Deterministic file IO
  - Save/open error handling
  - Bounded autosave intervals
  - Explicit unsaved-change prompts
  - Session persistence and safe restore

## User Value

- Write notes in a clean editor.
- See live resonance telemetry and guidance.
- Recover work automatically if the app closes unexpectedly.
- Preview markdown structure while drafting.
- Evaluate system behavior with reproducible benchmarks.
