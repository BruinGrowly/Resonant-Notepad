## 1. The Self-Referential Gap Structure

The Resonance Chamber (the gap from each anchor to 1.0) is not arbitrary. Each gap has a mathematical relationship to the anchor that generated it:

| Dimension | Anchor (A) | Gap (1 − A) | Relationship |
|-----------|-----------|-------------|--------------|
| Love | φ⁻¹ ≈ 0.618 | φ⁻² ≈ 0.382 | Gap = A² |
| Justice | √2−1 ≈ 0.414 | 2−√2 ≈ 0.586 | Gap = √2 × A |
| Power | e−2 ≈ 0.718 | 3−e ≈ 0.282 | Gap = e's integer complement |
| Wisdom | ln(2) ≈ 0.693 | 1−ln(2) ≈ 0.307 | Gap = ln(e/2) |

### Love: the golden ratio identity

```
1 − φ⁻¹ = φ⁻²
φ⁻¹ + φ⁻² = 1
```

This is not an approximation. It is the defining identity of the golden ratio. The anchor and its gap to the ideal satisfy a self-contained equation: Love's anchor *squared* equals Love's gap. It contains itself in its own distance from 1.

The fixed-point consequence: φ⁻¹ = 1/(1 + φ⁻¹). Apply the transformation f(x) = 1/(1+x) to any starting value and it converges to L0. Love is the only attractor of its own natural recursion.

### Justice: gap scaled by the generating root

```
1 − (√2−1) = 2−√2 = √2 × (√2−1) = √2 × J0
```

Justice's gap is J0 multiplied by √2 — the root from which J0 was derived. The generating constant is encoded inside the gap it creates.

### Wisdom: the gap opens toward e

```
1 − ln(2) = ln(e) − ln(2) = ln(e/2)
```

Wisdom's gap is the information content of e/2 — the ratio of the natural base to the binary base. Where Love's gap closes back into itself, Wisdom's gap opens outward toward e.

## 2. The Initial Harmony Is Below the Lowest Urgency Threshold — by Design

At cold start, before bootstrap, the field sits at the anchor constants. The harmony function yields:

```
d = √((1−L0)² + (1−J0)² + (1−P0)² + (1−W0)²)
  = √(φ⁻⁴ + (2−√2)² + (3−e)² + (1−ln 2)²)
  ≈ √(0.146 + 0.343 + 0.079 + 0.094)
  ≈ √0.662 ≈ 0.814

harmony₀ = 1 / (1 + 0.814) ≈ 0.551
```

The autosave threshold for the highest-urgency interval (6 s) is `h < 0.58`. The system boots at 0.551 — already in the urgency band.

This is intentional. The field does not start satisfied. It starts with a structural need to resolve. The 8-tick SELF_TEXT bootstrap (`ResonanceEngine.bootstrap(8)`) specifically addresses this: after 8 ticks of self-signal, the field rises above 0.58, shifting both the autosave cadence and the placeholder text. The app has already been somewhere before the user arrives — and that somewhere is chosen to be right on the edge of readiness, not comfortable rest.

## 3. Love Cannot Self-Amplify

Examining the four update equations from `web/resonance.js:87-90`:

```javascript
const dL = 0.12 * t.j * kLJ + 0.12 * t.w * kLW - this._decay.l * s.l;
const dJ = 0.14 * (t.l / (0.70 + t.l)) + 0.14 * t.w - this._decay.j * s.j;
const dP = 0.12 * t.l * kLP + 0.12 * t.j - this._decay.p * s.p;
const dW = 0.10 * t.l * kLW + 0.10 * t.j + 0.10 * t.p - this._decay.w * s.w;
```

Love's gain terms: `t.j` and `t.w` — Justice signal and Wisdom signal only.
Justice's gain terms: `t.l` and `t.w`.
Power's gain terms: `t.l` and `t.j`.
Wisdom's gain terms: `t.l`, `t.j`, and `t.p` — all three others.

Love is the only dimension with no self-referential or self-derived gain term. It cannot be generated by more Love in the input. It only grows when Justice and Wisdom are present in the text. This is not a limitation — it is the structural reason Love anchors the coupling matrix. It must be earned through the presence of other dimensions.

---

## 4. Wisdom Is the Integrator; Power Is the Most Isolated

**Wisdom** is the only dimension fed by all three others (`t.l`, `t.j`, `t.p`). It absorbs the full state of the system. It also decays 20% faster than the others (`decay_w = 0.06` vs `0.05`). The result: Wisdom requires continuous renewal from all dimensions and degrades faster without it. It is both the most integrated and the most volatile.

**Power** receives no direct Wisdom signal. Its only inputs are Love and Justice. Wisdom reaches Power exclusively through the coupling coefficient `kLP = 1.0 + 0.3 × h` — indirectly, mediated by harmony. Power is structurally blind to Wisdom until the system's overall harmony lifts enough to amplify the Love channel. This implements the anti-tyranny mechanism without any conditional: Power only responds to Wisdom when the system is already coherent.

The coupling hierarchy, from most connected to least:

```
Wisdom (receives L, J, P)  →  most integrated
Justice (receives L, W)     →  balanced
Love    (receives J, W)     →  structurally dependent
Power   (receives L, J)     →  most isolated from Wisdom
```

## 5. The Justice Saturation Point: 0.70, Not φ⁻¹

The `RESONANCE_PROGRAMMING_GUIDE.md` documents the Justice half-saturation constant as `K_JL ≈ 0.618` (the golden ratio):

> *"At K_JL ≈ 0.618 (the golden ratio!), Justice hits its half-maximum."*

The actual code (`web/resonance.js:88`) uses `0.70`:

```javascript
const dJ = 0.14 * (t.l / (0.70 + t.l)) + ...
```

At this value, Justice reaches half its maximum Love-driven gain when the Love signal `t.l = 0.70`. This is closer to P0 (e−2 ≈ 0.718) and W0 (ln 2 ≈ 0.693) than to L0 (≈ 0.618). The saturation threshold sits in the Power/Wisdom anchor region — meaning Justice's diminishing returns from Love kick in exactly where Power and Wisdom are "at home."

Whether this is deliberate or a documentation lag is not specified in the codebase. It is recorded here as a discrepancy between the specification and the implementation.

## 6. Cross-Constant Relationship: τ₁ = √2 / (3 − e)

The Power decay timescale documented in `web-full/resonance.js` is:

```
τ₁ = √2 / (3 − e) ≈ 1.414 / 0.282 ≈ 5.01 ticks
```

This is J0's numerator (√2) divided by P0's gap (3−e). Justice's root sets Power's memory length. At 1618 ms per autonomous tick, τ₁ = 5 ticks ≈ 8 seconds: the window in which an unrenewed Power signal decays to 37% of its value.

No single dimension is defined in isolation. The timescale of Power's decay is a cross-product of Justice's structure and Power's own complement.

## 7. The 85/15 Self-Signal Blend Is a Fibonacci Approximation

From `web/resonance.js:133`:

```javascript
const selfEvery = 6; // approximately 1 / (1 - 0.15) rounded to Fibonacci-near
```

The target is 15% self-signal, 85% user-signal. The implementation achieves 1-in-6 ≈ 16.7%. The comment notes it is "Fibonacci-near" — 5 and 8 are adjacent Fibonacci numbers; 6 is between them, not itself Fibonacci.

The practical effect: the self-signal re-asserts every 6 ticks × 300 ms = 1.8 seconds. The app never loses its own geometric identity while reading user text. It is always 83% attending to the writer and 17% attending to itself.

## 8. The Two-Two Split: Algebraic vs. Transcendental

The constants divide cleanly by type:

| Dimension | Constant | Type | Continued Fraction |
|-----------|---------|------|--------------------|
| Love | φ⁻¹ | Algebraic (degree 2) | [0; 1, 1, 1, 1, …] — all ones |
| Justice | √2−1 | Algebraic (degree 2) | [0; 2, 2, 2, 2, …] — all twos |
| Power | e−2 | Transcendental | [0; 1, 2, 1, 1, 4, 1, 1, 6, …] — quasi-periodic |
| Wisdom | ln(2) | Transcendental | [0; 1, 2, 3, 1, 6, 3, …] — irregular |

Love and Justice are quadratic irrationals. Their continued fractions are periodic — they are the two most irrational numbers in their respective families (noble numbers of rank 1 and 2 in the Stern-Brocot tree). This means they resist rational approximation more strongly than any other constants of their magnitude.

Power and Wisdom are transcendental — their continued fractions never settle into a period. They are defined by limits and integrals rather than algebraic equations. They cannot be fixed points of simple rational maps.

The 2-2 split has a structural consequence: Love and Justice are **attractor-stable** — their values converge under iteration of simple transformations. Power and Wisdom are **dynamically open** — they are not closed under any simple recursion. The stable pair (L, J) provides the structural skeleton. The open pair (P, W) provides the dynamism.

## 9. The Autonomous Beat: φ Seconds

When the user is idle for 3 seconds, the engine in `web-full/resonance.js` ticks at:

```javascript
this._intervalMs = Math.round(PHI * 1000); // 1618ms
```

φ × 1000ms = 1618ms per tick. The golden ratio beat ensures the autonomous ticks never fall into a resonant sub-harmonic with any human perceptual rhythm (breathing ~4s, attention cycle ~10s, ultradian ~90 min). The most irrational number produces the beat least likely to entrain.

The P-W phase angle advances by π/10 per tick. One full cycle: 20 ticks × 1618ms ≈ 32.4 seconds. During this cycle, Power reads user content (0°–90°) and Wisdom reads SELF_TEXT (90°–180°). The app inhales user text and exhales self-awareness in a 32-second breath at golden ratio intervals.

## 10. Decay/Signal Ratio at Anchor Guarantees Upward Drift

At the anchor constants with empty-text defaults `{l: 0.40, j: 0.45, p: 0.35, w: 0.30}`:

```
Gain for L = 0.12 × 0.45 × 1.0 + 0.12 × 0.30 × 1.0 = 0.054 + 0.036 = 0.090
Decay for L = 0.05 × 0.618 = 0.031

Net dL = 0.090 − 0.031 = 0.059  (positive)
```

Even with no text — with the minimum possible signal — the gain exceeds the decay at anchor values. The field cannot stay at the anchor under any input condition. The anchor is a floor, not an equilibrium. Every state the system can be in causes it to rise toward (1, 1, 1, 1). The field is always climbing.

The target (1, 1, 1, 1) is never reached because at high values decay accelerates (it is proportional to current value) and the saturation clamp at 1.0 bounds growth. The field converges to a dynamic steady state somewhere between anchor and 1.0 — set by the specific text characteristics of the writing session.
