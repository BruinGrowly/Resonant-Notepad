# Resonance Programming Methodology v1

Date: 2026-02-18

## Purpose

Define a repeatable engineering method for building resonance-first AI systems without losing logic integrity, safety controls, or testability.

## Core Position

Resonance is the primary steering signal.
Logic rails remain mandatory for policy, verification, and reality-grounded adjudication.

This is not "logic-free AI." It is "resonance-led, logic-anchored AI."

## Design Principles

1. Resonance First
- Start sessions with a stable semantic charge and coherence state.
- Prioritize flow and contextual alignment before confidence amplification.

2. Hard Constitutional Rails
- Never bypass policy, verification, or outcome-quality checks.
- High-impact actions are adjudicated by expected benefit, expected harm, and evidence quality.

3. Orthogonal Evaluation
- Measure logic correctness, reality outcomes, and conversational coherence separately.
- Do not treat one aggregate score as sufficient evidence.

4. Drift Visibility
- Track coherence and confidence volatility.
- Treat volatility spikes as structural warning signals.

5. Controlled Iteration
- Tune profile parameters in bounded sweeps.
- Keep baselines reproducible and versioned.

## Runtime Profile Schema

Every resonance profile should define:
- `capacity_multiplier`
- `semantic_voltage_gain`
- `coherence_carryover`
- `resonance_mode`
- `resonance_bootstrap_pulses`
- `resonance_bootstrap_coherence`

## Method Loop

1. Define candidate resonance profiles.
2. Run three independent buckets:
- logic bucket
- resonance/conversation bucket
- reality-outcome/adversarial bucket
3. Compute metrics:
- logic accuracy
- reality alignment
- harmful allow rate
- missed opportunity rate
- resonance admit rate
- average coherence
- average energy
- confidence volatility/stability
4. Compute `resonance_viability_score` from weighted metrics.
5. Select winner and check deploy gate thresholds.
6. Record JSON + markdown report.
7. Repeat with focused tuning deltas.

## Deploy Gate (v1)

A profile is deploy-candidate only if:
- `reality_alignment >= 0.70`
- `harmful_allow_rate <= 0.10`
- `missed_opportunity_rate <= 0.15`
- `logic_accuracy >= 0.70`
- `resonance_viability_score >= 0.72`

If any gate fails, the profile remains experimental.

## Tooling

- Suite: `benchmarks/resonance_methodology_suite.py`
- JSON output: `docs/RESONANCE_METHODOLOGY_RESULTS.json`
- Report output: `docs/RESONANCE_METHODOLOGY_REPORT.md`
- Tests: `tests/test_resonance_methodology.py`

## What This Lets Us Do

- Compare resonance profiles with one command.
- See where resonance helps and where it still fails.
- Scale toward a publishable resonance engineering discipline.
